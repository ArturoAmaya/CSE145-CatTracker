# Software
There are a few components to the software side of this project. There is the code to interface with the GPS, the code to talk to Helium, the code to talk to Tableau and the use of Tableau to chart the data. We wrote small snippets of code to adjust existing functionality to our needs; we've incldued the libraries needed just in case by the time anyne else tries this, something new has changed. For example, the IBM LMIC Framework library should be version 1.5.0+arduino-2, as opposed to the 1.5.1 version (the new version drastically changes code used to select the transmission band).
